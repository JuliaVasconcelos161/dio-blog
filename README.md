# Blog

This project was developed following DIO's challenge "Criando um Blog com Angular", the teacher [Felipe Aguiar](https://github.com/felipeAguiarCode) helped us to create a blog using Angular Framework. We've made 4 components to structure our pages, big-card, small-card, menu-title, and menu-bar.
